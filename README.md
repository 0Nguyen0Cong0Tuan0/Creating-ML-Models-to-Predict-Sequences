# ML Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on creating machine learning models for time series forecasting. It explains how to structure time series data by using a **windowed dataset** and implements predictive models that utilize past data sequences to forecast future values.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for time series forecasting
- Windowed dataset creation
- Machine learning models for sequence prediction
- Visualization of predictions and model performance

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb`.
2. Follow the steps to structure time series data and train predictive models.
3. Run the code cells to generate predictions and evaluate model performance.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Ensure you have these installed before running the notebook.

## Results
The notebook provides visualizations of the predictions made by the models, helping to understand the accuracy and efficiency of different approaches to time series forecasting.
